"I hope you realise that windows is more than just Office ? Its a whole system
that runs the computer from start to finish, and that is a very difficult
thing to acheive. A lot of people dont realise this."

"Microsoft just spent $9 billion and many years to create Vista, so it does
not sound reasonable that some new alternative could just snap into existence
overnight like that. It would take billions of dollars and a massive effort to
achieve. IBM tried, and spent a huge amount of money developing OS/2 but could
never keep up with Windows."

"Apple tried to create their own system for years, but finally gave up
recently and moved to Intel and Microsoft."

Confused whose quotes are these?

This is the comment given by [this][1] guy on [this][2] article.

And he talked this on [this][3] page.

"It wont be long until Windows XP is no longer supported, and when that
happens, what is Linux going to do ?

Linux will have to find a way to work under Vista from here on, since it wont
be able to rely on XP being readily available anymore.

Linux may seem like a good alternative to Office, but all that is happening in
linux is that the windows interface is cleverly hidden away. It still needs
the drivers and software services in order to run, and in most cases - that
happens WITHOUT a valid windows licence.

This is just plain piracy."

If you wanted to roll the floor laughing, then just read [digger's comments on
his "quotes"][4]

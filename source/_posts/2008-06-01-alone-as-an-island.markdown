No Black smoke from the vehicles, trees everywhere, expensive house rents,
photocopied places -- those were first differences I noticed between Chennai
and Singapore. And of course, traffic looks like it should be very boring for
drivers out here as against the free rollercoaster ride you get everytime you
get into the Chennai city with your bike. Its been two weeks since I left my
Chennai - the noisy city and my peaceful family.

Though not the first time out of my home or the country, this is the first
time I feel homesick for so long. This is the first place to where i come
alone to make new friends. But it is long since i stopped to believe in
coincidences. Whatever happens, it happens for good.

So, I am waiting for things to come by, "with a confused heap of impressions,
like a bewildered child watching a conjurers show".

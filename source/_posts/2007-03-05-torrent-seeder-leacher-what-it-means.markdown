**What is a seeder?** A seed(er) is a client on the Bit Torrent network that
has a complete copy of a particular archive. For any archive to work, there
must be at least one seed to download from originally. Sometimes under certain
circumstances, there may be no one seeder but enough people with all the parts
to make up the whole archive, this is called a distributed copy. It is HIGHLY
recommended that once you have gotten an archive you leave the Bit Torrent
client running for at least the amount of time that it took you to download
the archive to help ensure that others will also be able to get it. Share and
Share alike!

**What is a leecher? **A leech(er) is a client on the BitTorrent network that
does not have a complete copy of a particular archive yet. When any new client
begins downloading an archive, they are a leecher until they have finished
downloading the entire archive and then become a seeder. The name 'leecher'
here is an unfortunate use that has become too commonly used even though it is
really not applicable to what the meaning is. A leecher normally means someone
who downloads without uploading (takes but does not give.) But here, a leecher
is part of the network and is uploading as well, many times more KB than they
download. But hey, it's worth the new meaning once you appreciate the vast
resources that BitTorrent brings to you.

**What is a .torrent file?** To download something with BitTorrent, you must
have a .torrent file. This file contains in it a location that tells the
BitTorrent client where to go to find the tracker that manages the uploading
and downloading of the archive. An archive is a complete set for downloading
which may include one file or many files. The one .torrent file contains the
archive information also. To download on this network it is simply a matter of
clicking on the .torrent file in your web browser, then the BitTorrent client
kicks in and asks where you'd like to save the archive. That's it, from there
you just sit back and watch the client work it's magic.'

Now watch this video and and tell whether Windows could ever come closer to
this in the next 10 years comparing the sleekness and the memory consumption.
Beryl comfortably runs on 512 MB memory and a decent processor. Here is a
feedback by one of the bloggers.

"I've got Beryl running very nicely on a P3 800 with 512MB of RAM and a
GeForce 6200 card. The only thing that's slow is resize. Everything else is
pretty snappy."


Wanna try Ubuntu?

You can either order your Gnome version of ubuntu at
[https://shipit.ubuntu.com/][1]

or the KDE version of Ubuntu (I just love this) at
[https://shipit.kubuntu.org/][2]

What you can order is Kubuntu/Ubuntu Dapper Drake 6.06 which is 6 months old.
My personal advise is to download the latest version Kubuntu Edgy Eft 6.10 at
[http://www.kubuntu.org/download.php.][3] Stable, no spyware, no viruses, runs
comfortably on machines suffering from "low memory" disease. Ubuntu has its
new version released every 6 months. Next comes in April is Fiesty Fawn. You
can also download an Alpha release of it.

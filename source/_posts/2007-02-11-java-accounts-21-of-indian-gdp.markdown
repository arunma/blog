A report called "**Java Economy in India: A Pessimistic Estimate**", conducted
by Prof Rajanish Dass and Prof Rashi Goyal of the Indian Institute of
Management, Ahmedabad, has estimated the size of Indian Java economy at $14.65
billion for 2006, up from $11.27 billion a year ago.

That's **2.1% of India's GDP, expected soon to account for 2.5%. **The total
revenues of the Indian IT sector during 2005-06 were a little over $37
billion, of which over $10 billion were Java-related.

The IT software and services employment was estimated at 1.3 million at the
end of 2006. Of these, nearly 50% are Java programmers. **Indian Java economy
accounts for 10-15% of the world's Java economy.**

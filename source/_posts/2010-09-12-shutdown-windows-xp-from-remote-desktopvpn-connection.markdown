Funny story. I wanted to login to my office PC from my Mac due to some
emergency work only to see Murphy staring at me. My office windows PC got hung
and I was unable to do anything useful. I tried doing a "**taskmgr**" on the
Run Window but the window simply wouldnt come up.

I wanted to restart but unfortunately the Ctrl+Alt+Delete doesnt work on my
Mac the way it is intended to. After a lot of struggle, I managed to open a
command window and hit "**shutdown -r**".Â  Does the job.

Ever imagined your personal Operating System being carried along with you,
with all your files, email, personal settings and other software utilities. At
[PenDriveLinux][1], they exactly do this. They say "USB Linux installation
enables you to run the Linux operating system on any computer that can boot
from a USB flash device. This allows you to bring your operating system,
files, e-mail, personal settings, favorites and more with you. Itâ€™s like
having your own personal operating system you can carry in your pocket."

They also give tutorials on how to boot Ubuntu, Knoppix and a few other
distros of Linux from your USB drive.

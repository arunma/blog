Using del.icio.us at home and office, i find it difficult to synchronize the
bookmarks. Meaning, when i tag something at office, I am not able to view
those links in the "Recently Bookmarked" tab. What i do to overcome this is
either go to [**http://del.icio.us/arunodhaya80**][1] or just Logout and Login
for synching. Looks like del.icio.us is already working on the sync part.

Interestingly, i discovered another feature in the latest firefox del.icio.us
add-on. Here is the screenshot.

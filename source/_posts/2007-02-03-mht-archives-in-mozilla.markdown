If you were an Internet Explorer user and recently migrated to Mozilla, just
because you finally decided to ditch that buggy OS and embrace the lovely
Linux, you would have missed a few good (accidental) features of IE.

One, the creation of MHT archives is not possible in the "Vanilla" Mozilla.
Personally, i hate creating a folder and a html page for every single page i
save from the internet. I know you too are. We need it in one single pack.
Like the MHT archive in IE. Here comes the solution for Mozilla.

Find the plugin here.

Just open the file with Firefox and you are done with the installation
process. It works fine with my Firefox 2.0.

Two, the Image Toolbar in IE that comes up when we move our mouse over an
image. Mozilla does provide the same feature but as an add-on

Click Tools --> Add ons --> Get extensions

Search for Image Toolbar in the "Find More Addons" (our stuff comes up in the
second page)

There are a lot, lot and lots of add-ons available there. You could just
browse and find yourself lost. There was also some plugin for Orkut !!!

Here is my list of addons.

Mozilla is ruling the internet. Same is the effect on me.

I dont really speak javascript fluently.  Takes double the time to code than
Java.  If you are like me or if you dont want to spend lots of time
reinventing the wheel, then here is the list of some cool and commonly used
javascript functions.  This site has some of the core methods in some popular
javascript frameworks.  I personally used this getElementsByClassName() for a
project.  Trim function, cross-browser ajax requests, searching an array are
cool ones.

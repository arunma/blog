Earlier last year, Kerala opened the doors of its schools to Linux. Now its
the turn of its big neighbour, Tamil Nadu to choose Linux over Windows.

The Electronics Corporation of Tamil Nadu (ELCOT), which is the government
owned entity that brings IT-enabling services to the state has chosen Open
Source solutions over Windows-based solutions.

ELCOT decided in favor of open-source software because of its lower cost than
proprietary software from Microsoft Corp. and other vendors, C.Umashankar,
managing director of ELCOT, said Wednesday. Open-source software also provides
better ease of operation and higher security, he added.

Further, this could be just what is required for the state government to
choose Linux as well. **ELCOT will migrate to Linux at the server and the
desktop levels. Something tells me they might choose Ubuntu for their desktop.
Last year, the Ubuntu India mailing list saw some activity and the name ELCOT
turned up back then too.**

Here's why I think Google open sourced VP8.

If you think 120 million is a lot, think about this :

1)      HTML5 will run against VP8 which means that Apple cannot say no to
supporting it now.  All browsers have to support a STANDARD called HTML5. This
will destroy Apple’s ecosystem.

2)      Google is now praised by all the open source circles.. This translates
to lots of community building around its Android mobile platform.  (not to
mention the huge disappointment with the selection procedure for Apple store)

3)      VP8 open sourcing would mean that Linux will now ship with VP8 out of
the box.  This means that all the linux/freebsd users will now have a soft
corner for Google and its products in general.  Interestingly, Google Chrome 5
which was released yesterday suddenly ate a good percentage from Firefox.
Since “early adopters” primarily come from the open source circles, this would
mean unconditional support for Google products from now.

4)      Sun Microsystems always had a very friendly name in the technology
circles.  Now that it is dead and Oracle failed to fill in the “good
Samaritan” role, Google tries to adjust its feet to its shoes.

Bottom line :   Business, all along.

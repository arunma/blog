I was just looking for some aggregator plugin for Firefox when this struck my
eyes -- A complete **"social browser"**. Flock looks too good and has some
beautiful features. Best of all, the browser is **built on Firefox**.

**Linux and Mac? **Yes, of course. Beta still.

I took the liberty to steal the feature list from **[Wikipedia][1]**.

  * Flock's custom homepage, "My World", tells you when your friends have new
photos and videos and when you have new feeds. My World gives quick access to
your recently visited favorite sites as well.

  * Bookmarks, in addition to being saved offline, can be replaced with
**[del.icio.us][2].** When a bookmark (known as a _favorite_) is added, it is
added to the user's del.icio.us account.

  * Favorites can be tagged

  * A favorites and history section are integrated into the favorites manager

  * Built-in full-text search using [Clucene ][3](C++ implementation of
Lucene). Search as you type for pages in the cache

  * [Flickr][4] and [Photobucket][5] integration

  * [Technorati][6] tagging

  * [Blogging][7] tools

  * [News aggregator][8]

  * "[Drag-and-drop][9]" capability and a [clipboard][10] like feature known
as "The Shelf."

  * Media Mini Bar, allows you to search, stream, and view content off of
sites like [YouTube][11] and [Truveo][12].

  * Built in uploader, to submit content to [flickr][4] and [photobucket][5]

Here is your screenshot

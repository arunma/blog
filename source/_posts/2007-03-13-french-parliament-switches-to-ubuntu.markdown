The French Parliament looks to be the next big Ubuntu switcher according to
reports. Recently the Parliament produced an official government report that
recommended the use of free software over proprietary software.

This will amount to 1,154 new computers running Ubuntu prior to the start of
the next session which occurs in June 2007.

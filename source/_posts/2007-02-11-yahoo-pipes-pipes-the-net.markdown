![Yahoo Pipes][1]If you think Google is the best innovator, this week Yahoo
has proved that it not a competitor of lesser cadre. Yahoo made a breakthrough
announcement of **Yahoo! Pipes**. Yahoo Pipes are just like the Unix pipes
where we just transfer output from one command to another. Yahoo Pipes does
the same. Transfer data between Web services.

It helps RSS/Atom/RDF and even JSON feed types to be integrated to create what
we call as **"mashups".** So, if you are subscribing to a feed from A1 site
and A2 site, you can just get one single feed integrating the feeds of both
these sites. The best part is that everything could be done using a visual
editor. Not a single line of code.

"The Simplicity of the application helps the non technical user to take any
sources, user input requests or pre-configured modules and drag+drop them into
place and then connect the pipes."

Will post a screen by screen snapshot of Yahoo Pipes next week. Know more

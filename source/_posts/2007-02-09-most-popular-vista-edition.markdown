With just a few days passing by after the monstrously hyped Vista got
released, the Operating System is now taking up the most successful marketing
strategy of Microsoft. Pirated copies. :-) It was just 4 months, actually two
months before the release of first Edition of Vista that a grand white paper
was released by Microsoft in the name [Microsoft's Software Protection
Platform][1]   which states this as a conclusion :

Windows Vista and Windows Server “Longhorn” will be among the first products
from Microsoft to take advantage of the new Software Protection Platform, an
innovative platform from Microsoft that strengthens anti-piracy technologies
to help better protect customers and improve the overall licensing experience.

 Here is the recent edition of  Vista.

Some **"Iranian" ** hackers have managed to present the “**fully-cracked**”
version of the operating system.

The **pirated version** is presented by an Iranian Software company and also
has the possibility for its owner to have a legal serial number of the OS.
With the legal serial number the users can easily activate the OS from
Microsoft’s web site and enjoy all the benefits of buying a  Pirated  Original
version of the OS.

Still better is the cost of the pirated version. While the original version of
the OS is selling for around **$650** you can easily get your hands to this
pirated version for just **$8**. I don’t think this is the response that
Microsoft expected from their ‘**Most Advanced Operating System**’.

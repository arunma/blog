Did you notice this feature of gmail. Google had silently added this feature
into our mail ids. With his Mail Fetcher feature, you can just fetch mails
from other mail-ids (from yahoo, msn or whatever) and just view it in your
gmail. You just need to know the POP settings of them.

Google quotes that this feature is still to get functional. Just wait for a
few more days.

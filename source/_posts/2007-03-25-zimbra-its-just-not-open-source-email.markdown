[Zimbra ][1]is another wonderful example of community supported software
development. Started by three friends and widely supported and contributed by
the community, Zimbra is growing up as a serious challenge for Microsoft's
Exchange server. The exciting thing is that it offers features that are
unimaginable otherwise in an Outlook client.

Zimbra can work both inside the web-browser as well as in offline mode on
mail-clients as Eudora, Thunderbird, Outlook etc.

With the outburst of Linux desktops in home and the enterprise, Zimbra profits
on the Microsoft's lack of an email service in Linux system.

So, whats so great on Zimbra

1) You view a mail of some earlier day and "tomorrow" and "next Tuesday"
translates into relative dates.

2) A phone number gets recognized easily and a direct call to the mail sender
could be made through Skype or a configured caller program

3) Create your own customized RSS folders and read your feeds offline, just
like mails.

4) This feature is awesome. A mashup on the mail client. Your address calls up
the Yahoo map web service and the location of the mail sender is viewed on a
map.

These are just "few" of the features. If you interested in knowing all the
features, watch [this flash video.][10]

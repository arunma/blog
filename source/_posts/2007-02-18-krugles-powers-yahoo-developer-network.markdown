[Krugle][1], most famous open-source code search engine, now powers the [Yahoo
Developer Network][2] search. Not a simple step for Yahoo though, because
Yahoo just a few months back scrapped its Java code and developed its pages
using PHP. If you ask what Java has to do with Krugle, then this is the
answer.

[![Krugle Lucene][3]][4]

Krugle is built on top of Apache Lucene, 100% Java based search engine API. Is
Yahoo coming back to Java?

Developers talk: You can just try your hands on Lucene with just 4 or 5 lines
of code. Please search for Lucene/Nutch for more details. Mind blowing.

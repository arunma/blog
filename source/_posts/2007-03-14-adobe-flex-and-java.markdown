Adobe Flex is out and is already making ripples across the RIA world.
Recently, the book [Adobe Flex & Java][1] is also ready and is already
available online. Will grab a copy of the book and will let you know how it
is.

As of now, I am using [Adobe Flex 2 : Training from the Source][2]. Lots of
impressive code samples.

Also see : [Is Adobe Flex really the future of the Web?][3]

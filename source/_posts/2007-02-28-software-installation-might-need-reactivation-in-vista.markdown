A bug in Windows Vista's built-in antipiracy technology is telling some users
that they need to reactivate the operating system after they install new
device drivers or run newly installed software.Microsoft Corp. quietly issued
a patch designed to fix the flaw in its Software Protection Platform (SPP)
technology late last month. Criticized by some when it was announced last
fall, SPP is an updated and more aggressive version of the Windows Genuine
Advantage antipiracy tools that Microsoft included with Windows XP. But
because of the bug, SPP may suddenly demand that a copy of Vista be
"activated" even though the user and/or the computer maker did so earlier.

"You may be prompted to activate Windows Vista on a computer on which Windows
Vista activation was not previously required," Microsoft says "Although this
problem rarely occurs, it may occur during typical use of a Windows Vista-
based computer. For example, this problem may occur under one or more of the
following conditions: You install a device driver, you install a program, you
run a new program, you remove a program."

One Vista user, commenting, on Microsoft's Windows Vista Validation Issues
support forum reported that he ran into the bug after he had updated his PC's
BIOS. Oops!!!.

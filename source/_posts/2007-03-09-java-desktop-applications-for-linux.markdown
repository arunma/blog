Now that Java has been open sourced under the GPL, even the most strict of the
"free software only" distributions can start bundling it and integrating it
into their Linux distributions out of the box. Indeed, many of them already
have. In addition, the more ardent GPL supporters who have traditionally
shunned Java can now embrace it as a first class citizen of the OSS world.
Besides licensing Java under the GPL, The Swing team at Sun has also been hard
at work improving the look and feel on the Linux desktop in Java 6. Take a
look at the following two screen shots. One is the actual calculator from
GNOME, and the other is a mock up in Swing using Netbeans and Matisse. Can you
tell which is which?

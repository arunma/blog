computer and transfer to your mobile.

"Mini doesn't pull pages directly, but is kind of like a browser-front end, so
you can be assured that Opera's speed and screen-crunching powers will work
their magic without you having to download a 4MB JAVA app every time you want
to get on the Internet."

If you are a fanatic Mozilla user, you just need to point your browser to
[http://www.mozilla.org/projects/minimo/][4] for the Mozilla Minimo.

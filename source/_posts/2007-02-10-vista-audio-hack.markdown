Microsoft has recently acknowledged that [Vista’s built-in speech recognition
software could be exploited][1] by bad guys to delete files and even shut the
computer down. This clever hack works something like this: A Vista user
downloads and plays a malicious audio file, probably thinking that it a song.
Instead, the audio file begins barking commands through the computer’s
speakers, such as, “Delete all files in the ‘My Documents’ folder,” or,
“System shut down.” These verbal commands are picked up by the computer’s
microphone, processed by the built-in speech recognition software, and the
computer obeys. Crazy, huh?

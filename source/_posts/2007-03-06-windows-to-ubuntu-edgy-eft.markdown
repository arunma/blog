Every day, lots of people are slowly migrating away from Windows to Linux.
Vista just made the job simpler. This [screenshot filled tutorial ][1]  shows
how easy it is to migrate to the latest [Ubuntu 6.10 Edgy Eft][2].  The
advantages are clear: you get a secure system without DRM restrictions that
runs also on older hardware, and the best thing is: all software comes free of
charge.  Give it a try.

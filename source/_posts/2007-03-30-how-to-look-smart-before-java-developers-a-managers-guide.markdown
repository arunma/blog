Funny as hell. Enjoy.

  1. Before the initial project meeting go to jcp.org. List all JSR's learn
some (5 are enough in general) numbers and headers.. If you have to do with
more advanced developers - also read the abstract. Mention the JSRs during the
meeting and enjoy the impact.

  2. If you project is going to be a realized with Java EE: Emphasize the
verbosity of Java. Point to elegant languages like Python, or Ruby. (it is not
necessary to know these languages - it is not very likely, that they will be
used in a Java EE environment). If they are going to be chosen go to point 6.

  3. Mention JDK 1.7 and closures. (this strategy is very safe -> most
companies are just now thinking about upgrade to Java 5). In general it is
enough only mention the term "closure" in the context of Java.

  4. Wait a random amount of time. Pick one of the vs. issues and try to
initiate a dicussion; SOA vs. ROA, Ruby on Rails vs. Java EE, Thin vs. Rich,
AJAX vs. Rich, Swing vs. SWT, Netbeans vs. Eclipse, Java EE vs. .NET, SOAP vs.
REST and OSGI and JSR-277. The highlighted ones are more funny and the
discussion longer.

  5. Use terms like Web 2.0-ish, SOA-ish etc. Don't care about the meaning: no
one is able to define them.

  6. Suggest more esoteric languages like [Haskell][1], [Scala, ][2]or
[Fortress ][3]but not [Malbolge][4] for the realization. In general there is
no reason to doing that (Java is working well), but why not?

  7. Don't forget code generation. Sometimes it is enough to initiate a
discussion about MDA vs. MDSD. If nothing happens ask the developers about
PIM, PSM and code transformation etc.

  8. Very important: mention things like team velocity, pair programming, ask
about Xtreme-Programming, Agile, Scrum, Crystal, Test First, Mocking (the more
the merrier).

Yesterday i came across this particular system table USER_SOURCE.  Gives the
source SQL for a variety of Oracle objects including Procedures and Types.  I
dont have oracle installed in my home. So no screenshots.

You would have already known that USER_VIEWS table will give you the source
select statement of a VIEW.

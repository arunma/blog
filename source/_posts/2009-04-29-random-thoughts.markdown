1) Read that the open source movement got a big spur during the 2000 slow down
and researchers estimate another spur now. Very evident by the increase in the
number of participants and projects. Blessing in disguise but lets keep the
laid off in our prayers.

2) Planning for integrating IzPack into Snapman over the weekend.
Successfully implemented the InfixToPostFix conversion and evaluation
algorithm. Need to have more tricks in my bag (Man !! i really wish i got good
comp science education)

3) Had trouble running azureus on Jaunty Jantelope (Ubuntu 9.04). Executing
from terminal showed that it is looking for open jdk 6. So, just installed
Open JDK after uninstalling the gcj. Noob fix but still it solves my problem.

4) Bug # 1 in Ubuntu bugs.. hahhaha[ https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1][1]
Yup. Thats the real bug.

I think i seriously need to develop some expertise to write something daily
for my blog.

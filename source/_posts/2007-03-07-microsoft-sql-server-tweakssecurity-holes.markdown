This video just talks about another catastrophe that Microsoft has brought it.
These are  excerpts from a Microsoft TechEd training class on how to secure a
Microsoft SQL server.  A lot of tweaks, what he calls, to help plug those
security holes, breaks even the basic feature that we expect from the
database. The first feature that breaks is replication. What are going to do
with a broken database that cant be replicated too? Do we need to stop being
afraid of the open security holes that we have in our application and start
worrying about the database?

The guy coolly tells that "There is where most of the interesting 'things'
happen".  By 'things', he just means security holes.

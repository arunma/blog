We know that **Open Document Format or simply ODF is a widely used XML based
document representation format** **to which Sun is the key contributor**.
OpenOffice, KOffice and a lot other office suites stores its documents in any
one of the following OpenDocument formats by default

  * **odt** for word processing (**t**ext) documents

  * **ods** for spreadsheets

  * **odp** for presentations

  * **odg** for graphics

  * **odf** for formula, mathematical equations

Though, these suites support the proprietory and popular .doc, .xls, .ppt
formats, Microsoft had, for a long time gave a deaf ear to what happened on
the "other" side. It never even cared to support these formats for a long
time.

But after a biiiiiiigggggggggggggg annoucement by the State of Massachusetts
that "we cannot have our public documents locked up in some kind of
proprietary format, perhaps unreadable in the future, or subject to a
proprietary system license that restricts access", Microsoft started financing
the [**ODF plugin for Word**][1] last year (under BSD license, of course). A
lot of third parties, even before Microsoft, announced that they are
developing plugins for ODF in Office course). A lot of third parties, even
before Microsoft, announced that they are developing plugins for ODF in Office
environment.

All this happened last year. So, why this blog now? The popular open document
format has just been approved** **as an** ISO standard. **And the **Open
Document Foundation Inc has annouced complete development of ODF plugins for
Office suite**. With it, every 32-bit Windows user can use ODF. They are
planning to distribute the plugin bundled with the Google Pack. Oops !!!
(Google always gives me that heart attack).

Now that we see a huge migration of windows users to Linux flavours, this
plugin surely gives an extended life to MS Office. But then this should really
have given Gates a taste of his bitter future.

Edwards, co-founder and president of Open Document Foundation Inc, says that
he's now waiting for theÂ  **"Microsoft ODF plugin to show up. Microsoft has
said that if the demand is out there, they will produce it. If Bill Gates
holds up a finger to judge the wind for ODF demand today, he'll get his arm
ripped off." **:-)

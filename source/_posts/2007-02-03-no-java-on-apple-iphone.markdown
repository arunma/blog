**"Java's not worth building in. Nobody uses Java anymore. It's this big
heavyweight ball and chain."** This is what Steve Jobs quotes. Are they
planned to run a Enterprise Server on iPhone. I guess Java ME was created just
to enable Java to run on lightweight JVMs, especially Mobile phones. Millions
and millions of people are downloading Java games everyday. I dont really know
which planet Steve Jobs is in.

**Ironically, Steve also quotes "iPhone is not meant to be a Smartphone series
of phones". Without Java, it surely wouldn't be. **

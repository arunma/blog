[][1]If you have more than one gmail account and you use firefox, you are in
deep trouble. Coz, you will need to logout and login to the new account in
order to check mails.  If you are a Windows user, here come "a" solution for
it. A firefox extension called [**IE Tab**][2]**.**  "This is a great tool for
web developers, since you can easily see how your webpage displayed in IE with
just one click and then switch back to Firefox".

[![IE Tab][3]][1]

And if you are just like me being crazy about Firefox and/or use Linux in your
desktop, then IE Tab is not an option since IE Tab is just for Windows.

Here comes the solution for Linux/Mac & Windows users. [**CookiePie**][4]

**"CookiePie is a Firefox extension enabling you to maintain different cookies
storage in different tabs and windows. It means that you can for example open
multiple GMail/Yahoo Mail/Hotmail accounts in different tabs and windows
simulteanously."**

A lot many things in the recent past made me wonder if Adobe is becoming the
next Google?  If not in ads, at least on the innovation front.  The beta
release of Acrobat.com startled me and finding its features cutting edge
almost kept me dumstruck.

Impressed by the non-proprietory webtop office application Google docs,  a
year back, I give it a shot once a month (till now) and I log off with the
same feeling everytime that it still has a long way to go.  But everybody
knows that it was not google which started it all.

On the contrary,  Buzzword looks more "funky" (apologies for my natural bent
over flash applications) and fast (unlike "flash" !!!).  Learnt that there
could be a collaborative editing on the documents.

Gave web conferencing a try too. (Adobe Brio what they call it as).  Cool and
very much friendly. Features look similar to webex and best of all, its free.
Three is the max number of users in the conference.  But I dont personally
mind because I dont need to ask my friend to install VNC for helping him out
for an issue with his computer.

I dont want to give out a detailed feature list because thats [what experts
are for][1].

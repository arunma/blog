Sick of your .net applications and would love to have a button that just
converts your .net applications to Java? Here is it.

Started in May last year, NET2Java translates any .NET source code to Java
source code. It currently supports VisualBasic and C#.

The good news from NET2Java is that it got open-sourced under GPLv2 this month
and is currently in the incubator of java.net. There are however, previous
stable versions of the project.

"And if you have a friend struggling with .NET, do let them know there is an
exit strategy." ;-)

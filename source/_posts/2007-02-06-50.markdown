Just like Swiftfox is an optimized version of Firefox on Linux, that gives, if
not mindblowing, a faster response time compared to Firefox, here comes the
Camino for Mac. The sexiest thing about Camino is that it gives that Aqua look
of Mac with most of the features of Firefox built it : spell checking, single
window mode, bookmarks back-up, session saving. Though in its Alpha release,
[CNET][1] has already rated Camino as a better alternative to Safari, the
default browser for Mac.

Unlike its family members, Camino is built on Mac native Cocoa APIs and not on
the XML User Interface Language (XUL). This means that the browser will be
faster on Mac. But this also means that the add-ons that we use on Firefox
cannot be used on this browser since all the add-ons are built on XUL.

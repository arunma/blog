1. FileStuff provides information on over 5,000 **file extensions**. Use this
site to find out which application a particular file type/file extension
belongs to or to find out the default file extensions used by specific
software.

2. [BitTorrent goes Closed Source][4]. However, the protocol doesn't. You are
well off using Azureus.

3. The Mac crack, hack and software site, [http://www.macserialjunkie.com/][5]
goes down. Hope its just temporary.

4. The iWork '08 released a couple of days back is already available on the
torrent network ;-) 5. Visit [profit42.com ][6] if you are interested to dual
boot Mac OS X on your Intel PC. (I am not responsible for the legal trouble
you might face as a result of this action).

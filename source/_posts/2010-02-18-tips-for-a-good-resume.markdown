I am no guru in this and I am sure you could find a lot of resources  about
how to write a perfect resume.  Recently, a friend of mine passed me a resume
and asked me to suggest improvements and the technology he needs to update.
To my shock and dismay,  the resume was a total disaster.  Some things, which
we take for granted, turn out to be the most important ones.   I just happen
to sum up my personal thoughts in building a decent looking profile :

1)    Keep an **uniform font** for the resume. I see a lot of profiles with
different fonts spilled all over. Using italics and bold to highlight is fine
but different fonts irritate the eyes.

2)   ** Tabulate the professional experience, education and skillsets**.  I
understand that it is a bad idea to tabulate when you wanted to pass the
profile as plain text.  But AFAIK, doc and pdf are the standard formats i have
circulated my CV as (I am a big fan of Pareto).

You will be shocked to know that the consultants take no more than 5-10
seconds to process your resume for a position (i saw it myself). Nobody except
you is interested in reading the entire profile.

3)   ** Highlight your prominent skillsets and be precise**. You are trying to
sell your profile to a technical person and he will be interested in knowing
the version of software you are experienced in. Spring and Java doesnt convey
anything. How about Spring 2.0 or Java 1.5 or even better Concurrency API in
Java 1.5?

4)    Trust me, this is not going to help ---

_**Responsible for: **Team Management, Project Management, Co-ordination with
clients and Production Support._

**Explain in detail your role in the project**. Highlight your achievements.
something like... "being a co-developer and team manager, i was involved in
full development of the case folder module".. or whatever. Please don't lie.
Sooner of later, they will find out. Just be more detailed in what exactly you
did.

**Highlight your expertise.** If you are a developer, highlight your
development experience. Highlight the various technologies you have worked in.
Show the depth of your experience.  Having a tabulated list of the technology
against the experience (in months) is not a bad idea.

** Tally your years of experience with your expertise.** Mentioning that you
are into team leading and project management and have lost touch of
development when you have less than 5 years experience makes no sense at all.
If you are applying for a programmer role, let your resume show it.

5)    Put in an** "Achievement" section** and highlight only the relevant
achievements - both academic and work related. People will be very much
interested in looking at it.

6)    **Update your skillset**. Resolve to learn at least one new technology
(or get expert knowledge in the known one) every couple of months. Learn a new
language every year.  Not all technologies and languages will suit your taste.
And you can't develop a taste for something which you have never tried even
once.

**Choose essential and related skill sets:** Come on, you and I know that VSS
doesnt tally well with a Java developer. Gain experience in SVN at the minimum
and  a DVCS (git for example) going forward. Knowledge of the automated
testing frameworks (JUnit to start with) is a must.

7)    **Read a lot of books or atleast the [minimum needed][1], have a pet
project (even better, involve in an open source project) **and highlight it on
your resume. It shows that you have lots of passion for your work.

Feel free to drop in a comment if you feel the need to add more to the list.

When it comes to Ajax what are the most common things you do?

1)  [Avoid browser cache for GET requests.  ][1]

2) Hit the server wit that 'special' javascript and populate single/multiple
div tags.

3)  Get data as XML/JSON and parse the data  to populate the html page

4) Populate the data in a new Tab instead of a div.

If you really want to know the top 5 patterns that any AJAX user would be
falling under (along with code snippets), here is the [page from ibm.com][2].

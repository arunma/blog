This site really drove me crazy. AJAX based drag and drop and then upload is
completely taken care by Java. The centre "Drop your files here" is nothing
but an Java applet. Just View source it to see this....


    <object type="application/x-java-applet;version=1.4.1"

                        width= "200" height= "200"  id="rup" name="rup">
<param name="archive" value="dndplus.jar">


                 <param name="code" value="com.radinks.dnd.DNDAppletPlus">

After uploading you get a link for download. Just pass the URL to your friends
and enjoy.

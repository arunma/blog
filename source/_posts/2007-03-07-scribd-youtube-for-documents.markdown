Yesterday, the long awaited "You tube for Documents" site  [Scribd][1] came
out of its beta. It is a social network that lets you tag, share, and comment
on uploaded documents (.doc, .pdf, .txt, .ppt, .xls, .ps, .lit). Scribd is not
just a carbon copy of YouTube. They borrowed a lot of the basic design
principles, but also took advantage of the written format by including
flexible file formats for download and upload along with some interesting
analytics tracking. Documents can be displayed and embedded as html or the
under-utilized, and faster-than-a-pdf, Flash paper format. They can be
downloaded as .pdf’s, .docs, .txt, and even .mp3 files. The mp3 version is
created by Scribd’s text-to-speech package that lets you listen to the text of
your document in a quivering British accent.

If you find time, please do check this site too...

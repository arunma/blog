Wow Wow Wow. By God's grace, this year had a wonderful start. Beginning with
Jason's 1st birthday on 7th and the Merrill interview on the same day,
vacation to home and the best of it all - re-joining Merrill. Needless to say
that i always enjoyed working in Merrill. Of course, it means less amount of
family time but at least at the end of the day, i will have a satisfied heart
that i have done something worth.

I fondly remember the first 4 months in ML India when working till 2 AM is
almost a daily event. What the heck. I am awake till 2 AM even here in
Singapore fighting with the code. I love programming and i'll do it till death
does us apart. That's right, ML is aggressive but so am I.

Now that everything is settled and I have a definite and promising road in
front of me, I am resuming my work on the personal projects - our lunarcodes.

I wanted to write an app which indexes all the ebooks, movies and songs on my
machine and use amazon or google or any other webservice to fetch meta
information about them - including the cover pictures, popularity, reviews and
any other information that could be possibly useful. I seriously dont want a
bloated webapp for this. A pretty SWT/Swing would be great. Flex would be
brilliant but AFAIK i dont see any good search and index libraries for Flex.
Flex and Java would require a server running which I dont want to. Python, on
the other hand, has Lucene extensions and has good web service support too but
felt that nothing would come close to using the original lucene libraries
instead of extensions.

Ah... i really love this year.

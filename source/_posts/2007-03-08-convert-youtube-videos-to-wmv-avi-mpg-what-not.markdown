I really dont know how i found this site. Just followed some strange links and
found the treasure. [http://www.mediaconverter.org.][1] You could just paste
your youtube url and then directly get the converted file readymade.
Optionally, you can also upload your media file and get it converted. Few
seconds spent on registration is worth it.

Here is the screenshot of the console page.

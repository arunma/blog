_**Sub domain**_

  * Lets say your domain is **_mysite.com_**.

  * You install a Message Board and put in in a directory called
**_mysite.com/_board_/_**.

  * You can turn the directory _**board**_ into a sub-domain by adding it as a
sub-domain from your Control Panel.

  * Now you can access your Message board as either **_mysite.com/_board_
_OR** **__board_.mysite.com_**

  * This costs you nothing and is free.

_**Parked Domain**_

  * You have two domains _**mysite.com**_ and _**my-other-site.com**_.

  * _**mysite.com**_ is the domain of your website and you want to add _**my-
other-site.com**_.

  * You want them both to go to the **same place**. In other words, when
someone types either _**www.mysite.com**_ or **_www.my-other-site.com_** they
will go to the **same** page(s) on your website.

  * In order to have additional parked domains you need to purchase the
additional domain(s).

_**Add-On Domains**_

  * You have two domains _**mysite.com**_ and _**my-other-site.com**_.

  * You want the two domains to be **totally separate/independent** websites.

  * In order to have additional parked domains you need to purchase the
additional domain(s).

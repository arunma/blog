Before switching to [Kubuntu][1], I was using Freespire (free edition based on
Linspire linux) for a few weeks. It looked a lot like Windows. (no wonder it
was initially named as Lindows). I liked that inbuilt proprietory audio and
video codecs and the **Click-N-Run (CNR) **feature of it. Just imagine an
executable living inside a Linux operating system. But after switching over to
Kubuntu, I never turned back. With **good hardware support**, lots of help
from user groups, **6-month release cycle**, I could never want any other
thing on my system. Frankly speaking, i dont dual boot. Just Kubuntu.

Whats all this story about.

**Linspire will now immediately transition to Ubuntu as the base for their
Linspire and Freespire operating systems, and Ubuntu will utilize Linspire's
CNR technology for Ubuntu's software delivery system.**

You might ask. But aren't they competitors? Of course, they are. Guess what
they say about this new partnership.

"While both companies, and their respective projects, do compete at certain
levels, both are interested in seeing greater desktop Linux adoption and
growth. By joining forces they can work together to focus more attention on
addressing common challenges Linux faces in a world dominated by Microsoft
Windows"

I was reading this article on slashdot and found this response particularly
interesting. :-)

> What the fuck is "netbeans"?

They are the seeds of the internet. You plant some and sprinkle them with
bits. Eventually they grow into a huge series of tubes. How do you think the
internet was created? With lots and lots of netbeans.

RedHat Linux and Solaris, MySQL and Oracle, Bea backed Eclipse and NetBeans,
Peoplesoft, Siebel ... good for Oracle but doesnt it sound more "Microsofty?"

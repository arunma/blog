**Crux :** All new tech items will be posted on to [rerun.me](http://rerun.me) 

**What? Another blog? Why ? ** 

Over the past few years, as part of my college and outside, I managed to read some very interesting books and some cool stuff managed to stick in my brain. A few of them got retained in few notebooks and evernotes - all of which are terribly difficult to find when you need them. So, I decided to take a deliberate attempt to take some time and log all the most interesting information in an organized manner. And in the process of doing so, I don't want to be a  selfish @$$. So, here you go. [http://rerun.me](http://rerun.me)

**So, what's up with arunma.com?**

Oh. Yeah. I am still unsure of how I am going to use this one. Now that all my mail ids are bound by google apps, I can't shut it down (Frankly, I don't want to). Few of the options that I could think of is to start whining about life or how great my family is. One of my friends was suggesting that I write an autobiography (huh??!!!). Just kidding. 

As always, my ideas are dumb. Mail yours to arun AT arunma.com

Its Great news. And i am glad to share it with you all. Firefox downloads had
now reached a whopping 300+ million downloads since its inception in November
2004. On an average it means** more than 3,60,000 downloads each day.**
Personally, its been long time since I stopped using Windows. Initially, I
missed Internet Explorer and never used tabbed browsing even in Firefox (those
features not in IE). But I chose to follow the migration rule **"Try anything
for 21 days and it becomes a habit". **But it was just a week and a few days
that i got addicted to firefox, with thousands of cool plugins and themes and
easy customization with that "about:config" page. Now, turning back i say to
myself... "What features in Internet Explorer, if at all it had some, did i
miss in Firefox initially?

Feel like moving to Firefox? Just click a few pixels below...

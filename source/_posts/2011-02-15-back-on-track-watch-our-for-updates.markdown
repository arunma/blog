I have been doing so many crazy things in the last quarter of last year and
this year so far. And interestingly, all turned out to be very good.  Lets
say, staying hungry and foolish really pays. So, I felt the need to revamp my
blog (my blog being brought down to its knees last month by an attack is
really a blessing in disguise).

So, please watch out for the updates.  I will try my best to make it regular
and useful.

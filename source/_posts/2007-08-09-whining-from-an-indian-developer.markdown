It really pains to find posts in sun.com like **[this][1]. **And the
reactionary blog posts like [**this**][2]. Look at the code flaws that the
blogger has pointed out. These flaws are not supposed to be made even by a JSP
first-timer. I wonder what book the developer went through before writing
something like this. Fortunately, the bloggers, [Tim O'Brien][3] and [Jamie
Flournoy][4], have not indulged into rude criticism against the JSP question
by a Wipro employee.

I have personally experienced the swapping of "rockstars" and "newbies"
happening in one of the projects of mine when a portion of it was outsourced
([tips for outsourcing][5]). Managers are just anxious about their immediate
victories in getting the contract for a project, but sooner or later, the
client loses the trust that it initially had. "The best advertisement is a
satisfied customer". The client will, in future, not only look upon
alternatives to the company for outsourcing, but also may create an aversion
towards outsourcing.

And, it is my humble request to my fellow developers to learn things before
they actually put them into use in the project. Of course, we get projects
just because our labour is cheap. But again, we are paid on par or even more
than any other profession in the country. The cream of the population wants to
immigrate to a richer country. Please do remember that the Indian GDP growth
rate went up from 7% to 9% in the last few years. It is not because of those
immigrants. The bulk of foreign exchange is earned by the Indian companies
which got the outsourced projects. Loss of project means lots to the country.
Bad quality of work will only result in immediate gains. No point in earning
money for yourself without laying a foundation for your future and the future
of your children. Indian labour has till date earned the name of "cheap"
labour. This is just becoming "poor quality" labour day by day.

If you are moved to a project with a completely new technology, learnt it
before you put that into work. We, fortunately, have a rich collection of
Indian edition books which are also available for lesser cost. Only that extra
mile is going to save us and our country.

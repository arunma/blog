**"Oracle has just announced from EclipseCon that it is donating the TopLink
O/R persistence framework to the OSS community. This is a fairly substantial
contribution of code." **

Here are some info on the framework.

When you are using Oracle as your backend, you really might want to prefer
Toplink over Hibernate. From the house of Oracle (at least after all those
buyouts), it obviously has lots of support for Oracle database. On the other
side too, it looks like **it has a stable caching and lazy loading mechanism
than Hibernate. **People have used Toplink against other databases in
Production environment and they just say it performs slightly better than
Hibernate.

**"If you are using the Oracle DB then support for hints, hierarchical
queries, XDB XML Type with query constructs, Object-Relational database types
with queries, many SQL extended function and types (TIMESTAMP*, NCLOB, ...),
excellent support for complex stored procedures and functions, as well as
support of Virtual Private Database will definitely be key factors in your
comparison." (source : oracle.com)**

Toplink has been in the market for over 10 years now. But what stopped it from
becoming popular? Struts had better documentation whereas Webwork had a better
framework. Same is the case with Toplink. **Lack of good documenation
initially and the cost involved in buying Toplink (Toplink was, of course,
commercial initially) were the top things that were stopping Toplink from
becoming popular. **Now that Toplink has good documentation and become
opensource, what's stopping us?

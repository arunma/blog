I am sorry to say this. **Indian Java economy accounts for 10-15% of the
worldâ€™s Java economy but still many of us dont contribute to open source. **We
basically just have been leechers.

I recently read a mail which describes us as coders. We are not developers or
programmers. We dont develop new things. We dont create new programs. We just
write code. Just like data entry operators.

Richard Stallman, the brain behind the GNU GPL, quoted, "When i was a kid in
school, my teacher used to say when i bring candies to school, 'Share it with
your friends. Sharing is good'. But when i grew up, i really got surprised
when people said no to sharing software. Thats illegal they said. Sharing is
illegal".

We do have social responsibility. We do need to give back what we got. Dont
we?

If you really feel what I feel, please watch this video

How and why Linux evolved. How and why GPL evolved. How is Microsoft cheating
us. I promise that this is the best video you are ever going to watch in your
life. I cried.

With Feisty Fawn due this 19th, the stage is all set for the next player to
show its trick.  Strange enough, the next release of Ubuntu is named Gutsy
Gibbon.  A treat for the code monkeys, i guess.

Unfortunately, Gutsy will not be an LTS (Long term support) release. [**This
**][3]** **is Mark's letter to the community.

(FYI : i never knew that zeroconf is configured by default in Feisty Fawn.
Meaning, file-sharing will now be a breeze)

When it comes to early adoption of technologies, Eclipse stands behind
NetBeans. Sun and the NetBeans Community,  last week, announced an early
access release of the NetBeans Ruby Pack which provides support for the Ruby
programming language.  As you already know that JVM will now allow scripting
languages to be run on it.

The NetBeans plug-in offers developers added support for dynamic and scripting
languages and includes editing features for both Ruby and JRuby - a 100% pure-
Java implementation of the Ruby programming language that runs on the Java
Virtual Machine.

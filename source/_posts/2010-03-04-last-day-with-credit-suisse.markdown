I recently read a quote about writers - Writers don't write because they have
to say something. It's because they have something to say.   That was exactly
what went through my mind when I was asked to give a speech today in my
farewell lunch. I have a lot of things to say but I just cant say anything,
leave alone something.  I always used to wonder during the farewell lunches,
"How is that these guys who leave are not thankful for the days they spent
here. How come they dont speak a word" and as always my immediate thought
would be "Nah.. I will just give that movie-like pep talk".  "I am awesome".
"I can do more than that".   Interestingly, I was no better than anybody else.

It is saddening to leave CS.  Thankfully, it is not the "invariably saddening"
kind.  I have nothing to repent.  In fact, the past couple of years taught a
lot about confidence, communication, trust and that there is a time for
everything.  CS is really a wonderful place to work.  Peaceful, organized and
balanced.

Two years ago, I came here as a lonely man. Nobody to talk to.  But today, It
is a wonderful feeling to see that all my friends came together to host a
farewell lunch for me.   What did i do to them? Nothing.   You bet, I will
miss all of them.   From Monday, I can't meet them personally too often as I
do today but then I learnt from life that long distance relationship don't
work, unless the relationship is friendship.

See you around.

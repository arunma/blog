[][1]It is common for many projects to be renamed, following lawsuits by
proprietory companies.  Linspire is what comes to my mind immediately.

But it is very rare for a project to be renamed the second time :-)  **Gaim**
has earned this special reputation.  Following the lawsuit by AOL, the **GTK+
AOL Instant Messenger** was renamed as Gaim.

Now that AIM is trademarked by AOL, Gaim was (force) renamed to **Pidgin** on
April 6, 2007.  The libraries "Libgaim" was renamed to libpurple, while "gaim-
text" became "Finch".

The newer version, Pidgin has a lot of fixes and features in it which includes
voice/video (I was waiting for this).

Here is the screenshot.

For non-linux users,  here is your info.  Pidgin is  a popular multi-platform
instant messaging client that supports many commonly used instant messaging
protocols (meaning you can run YM, AOL, Gtalk etc at the same time using one
single client). Intially developed for Unix-like operating systems, Pidgin now
runs on a variety of platforms, including Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux,
FreeBSD, SkyOS and Trolltech's PDA system, Qtopia.

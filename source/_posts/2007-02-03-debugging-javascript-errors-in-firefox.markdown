You know very well that Mozilla Firefox is a much much better browser than the
IE. But one thing i missed during development testing with Firefox is the
debugging of Javascript error messages. IE would just pop us a very useful
'Object expected' message. ;-)

Ignorance had the best in us. Actually, Mozilla gives a wonderful Javascript
AND CSS console to play with. To view the console Click TOOLS -- > Error
Console.

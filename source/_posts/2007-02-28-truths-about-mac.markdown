**You'll be able to ignore most viruses** Each time the Windows community gets
up in arms about the next big virus that is circulating around the globe, you
can go about your business on your Mac without really worrying. However, you
do have to be careful to not forward on infected files from one Windows user
to another.

**People will help you for no reason** Other Mac owners are usually fairly
willing to help you get up and running on the Mac. This may be self-serving on
their behalf, because it helps sell more Mac stuff which in turn justifies
their investment in a company with less than 10% market share, but it's still
a perk.

**You'll have some "ah-ha" moments** From time to time you'll be pleasantly
surprised because the Mac will do something that you completely didn't expect,
because you're used to how Windows would do things. For instance, you put a
picture into the Address Book, and it appears automatically in iChat and then
on your phone.

**Keyboard shortcuts will drive you nuts** I spent years honing the craft of
keyboard shortcuts on Windows, to the point where it was mostly muscle memory
pressing the keys for me. On the Mac, it seems like there are two or three
different ways that the various shortcuts are implemented, and it drives me
nuts to this day.

**You'll regret your purchase, but you'll get over it** You'll have a few
moments where you really, really wish you had purchased that Dell laptop for
$399, and you'll seriously consider taking the Mac back to the store, but
eventually you'll get over it and wonder what the hell you were thinking.

**You'll spend more money than with Windows** From the initial hardware
purchase, to software, to more frequent OS upgrades, you'll likely end up
spending more money than someone with a Windows box - but you'll find you
often get good value for your extra money. And Apple will keep coming out with
new shiny objects that you really, really want to have.

**You'll generally sell your used Mac for a decent price** Apple computers
tend to retain their value better in the used marketplace. Even a two-
generations-back non-Intel laptop will sell for $250-300 on craigslist.

Even though the idea of free Flex is exciting, I was one of the many who
complained that [**Flex should be made open source**][1]** **than free. But
today, Adobe made a [**press release **][2]stating that the source code of
Flex is to be released soon under [**Mozilla Public License**][3]. MXML,
ActionScript compiler, command line debugger and Flex framework are among the
list of those that are to be opensourced. However, the eclipse-based Flex
builder still remains in Adobe hands.

FYI : Last November, Adobe announced the source code contribution of its
ActionScript Virtual Machine2 (AVM 2) to the Mozilla's [**Tamarin
**][6]project. Adobe says that AVM2 is about 10 times faster than the AVM1
that we use on our browsers now. The Tamarin code will be included within
SpiderMonkey, the open source JavaScript engine used by Firefox and other
applications based on Mozilla technology (available in 2008).

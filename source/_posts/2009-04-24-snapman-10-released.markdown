I was looking for something like JScreenSpy for monitoring my laptop's usage.
Unfortunately, there isnt something around except JScreenSpy and a portion of
JScreenSpy rewritten in Python (pyScreenSpy). More to my disappointment, I
found no source code for the project.

So, I thought I could write something myself and released "SnapMan" yesterday.
[https://sourceforge.net/projects/snapman/][1]

Here goes the description of the project

> SnapMan is a tiny java program with an integrated timer (opensymphony
quartz). It takes snapshots of your desktop in regular intervals and saves it
into a specified folder. Intervals and target folder is made configurable.
Intervales are all Cron/At compatible.

The code is released under GPL. This is my first "public" code. So, please let
me know if i need to improve (or tell me i am nowhere).  All constructive and
destructive comments are welcome.

I will probably be writing a Cron expression generator this weekend because i
find it very difficult to pick up.  I specially like the Gnome Scheduler
interface (Python) with immediate translations to plain english.

I am also planning to make the target folder of the pictures encrypted (any
pointers will be highly appreciated)

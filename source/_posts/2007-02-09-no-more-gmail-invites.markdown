Wish you had that **Sign up **link in Gmail instead of asking your friends to
give an invitation? Very soon that will happen. Google has already given up
its invite-only policy in certain countries.What i see is that US, Australia,
Newzealand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, some European countries and Brazil
are already availing this offer.

And Google terms this move as a step in the "ongoing growth strategy". As if
they had not grown enough !!!

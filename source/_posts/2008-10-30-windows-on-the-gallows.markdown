No offence. Being a programmer i understand how hard it is to develop and
maintain a simple web application.  And creating an operating system is no
child's play. I fully understand.  But there are some compelling questions
which come to my mind whenever i hear of the news about Windows 7.  Leave an
offending note if you find my questions too naive.

What did Microsoft have in mind during the release of Vista?  That they could
change the whole consumption pattern of the PC users?  "Vista has come out.
Let's sell all our hardware and buy new ones. Oh yes. Even the one you bought
2 weeks back".  Wow. Didn't they learn the Windows Me lesson --  a bad product
will not be bought.

Windows 7, on the preview, looks exactly like Vista with the "Aero" look.  I
am sorry. My mind maps "Aero" with "Slow".  Microsoft claims that they have
considerably reduced the size of the operating system to run on "lesser
configured" machines.  WOW-Addition by subtraction!!!

As far as my understanding of the Windows OS is concerned, Windows is
definitely not modularized.  History tells that, that is the reason they came
up with the crappy idea called "registry". If somebody tells me that Linux
could work live from a floppy,  I won't feel surprised.  But how can they just
strip off things from a non-modularized heavyweight like Vista?  By pressing
the "Delete" key? And don't tell me that Windows 7 is not an extension of
Vista but is a totally new operating system kernel and a whole new
architecture.  It would sound like IE 7 is definitely not IE 6 because it has
tabs.

I seriously doubt whether Windows 7 had the "being lightweight" goal during
its planning stages.  It looks like it is a marketing strategy.  With Mac
sales booming up and more people migrating to Linux or even worse downgrading
to XP,  how are they going to retain their market share.  Lots of Corporate
customers have already downgraded their OS to XP.  Heard that Windows has made
a 4% loss on Vista sales.  Scoop news is this - Windows 7 was supposed to be
released in 2010 and heard today that they are planning to release it in the
mid 2009. Pre-release in the history of Microsoft? Unbelievable. I hope you
all remember the wait time for Vista after the scheduled release date.

Gadgets all over the desktop instead of the side bar (like Mac), the new touch
interface (like apple products), virtual disks (like Solaris) and of course
"Linux" like stability -- all these doesn't sound something new.  Has
Microsoft totally lost creativity? Isn't this the same house that popularized
the WIMP?

Surprisingly, I saw somebody comparing SnowLeopard with Windows 7.  Must be
Steve Balmer.

In my opinion, Microsoft had their chance and they blew it up. Period.

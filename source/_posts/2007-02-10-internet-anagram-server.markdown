We used to play this game in our school days.. Just pick a large word and find
new words by just rearranging those alphabets. Person with the largest number
of words wins. Right? Those are anagrams.

eg.

** Microsoft Internet Explorer = Expect online terrors from it**

** Microsoft Windows !! = Ow! Discomfort Wins !**

;-)

Now you can just get the list of anagrams for a word just by sending a blank
mail to [wsmith@wordsmith.org][1].

Or just visit [http://wordsmith.org/anagram/index.html][2]

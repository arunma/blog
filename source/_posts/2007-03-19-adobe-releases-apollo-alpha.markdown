**Adobe Apollo**, the cross-operating system runtime being developed by Adobe
that allows developers to to build and deploy rich Internet applications to
the desktop, is OUT for its Alpha.

[![Apollo logo][1]][2]

**"Apollo is the combination of the advantages of web applications (network
and user connectivity, rich media content, ease of development, and broad
reach) and that of the desktop applications (application interactions, local
resource access, personal settings, powerful functionality, and rich
interactive experiences)**

There is a few more days you have to wait for the final version. But then, who
cares. You can play with it NOW.

You can grab the [runtime][3] and the [SDK for Mac and Windows][4] to start
building.

There are [sample applications][5] to get inspiration from, and you can [watch
the DEMO 2007][6] talk.

Microsoft is becoming a house of ironies in more ways than one.   Sick support
of ODF on Office 2007 SP2 has been old news. Now the latest news hanging
around is that their search is going to be Hadoop/Hbase based.  I am sure you
are already thinking "Isnt Hadoop, an Apache project?". Yes it is. So much for
the anti-open source shouts from them.

MS Search = ( ( ((Hadoop)Lucene)Java) + ASF) && (! .Net) && (!Dignity)

That's their business formula, I guess. I wish i could curse now !!!

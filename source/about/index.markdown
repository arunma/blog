I am **Arun Manivannan** and I write code â€“ code with which I am going to make that little dent in the universe. I am perpetually curious about new technology, software, big data, food and basically anything new or things I found new.  I love creating new software and Bank of America pays me for the ones I create during the day. In this blog, you'll find my thoughts on things that fancies me most - programming, technology, gadgets and life.

I was raised in Chennai (Madras), a beautiful city with warm people in the Southern part of India. I currently stay in the friendly and creepily clean Singapore.

My professional experience has centered around programming, analysis, design and architecting Enterprise Java applications in Telecom and Investment Banking organizations. 

I love showing off to my friends and since all my friends are geniuses, everyday is a real challenge. I love and enjoy my craft and therefore I sharpen my skills on my free time. My personal projects are scattered over github, google code and formatted harddrives.  I recently wrote a Twitter server based on XMPP PEP and PubSub and a Loggly alternative using Hadoop MapReduce and Spring.

** Thought you'd never ask : **

* I am happily married to **Daisy Lavanya** and I am the proud father of that naughty boy called **Jason**
* I like listening to **alternative rock** and anything else that makes the heart pump faster
* I love taking pictures on my DSLR even if I know I am bad at it
* **Sci-fi** movies - Why does any other kind of movies exist?
* I love **big data** and I am working hard to find somebody who would pay me to work in the **cloud**
* I am doing my **Masters in Technology** at the National University of Singapore
* I work hard and juggle time a LOT to manage my work, school and family
* I love playing **badminton** and could make the newcomers cry a little
